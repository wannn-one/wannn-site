                        I started my career in programming when I was accepted into Computer Engineering Bachelor. I learned C# which was a request from my father. I still remember one of the assignments given, which was a simple game of rock paper scissors with 2 user inputs. However, I studied C and C++ in a basic programming course at college. Moving on to 2nd semester, I studied class, STL C++, and an introduction to data structures in advanced programming courses. I learned web programming while being a commitee of MAGE 8 (Multimedia and Game Event) as Junior Backend Developer.

                        In 3rd semester, I studied data structures, where the final project was to make a game using the SFML library with the C++ programming language. At 4th semester, joined in Barunastra Roboboat Team as Intern Programmer that responsible for datasets labeling and training. We achieved 1st Place Autonomy Challenge & 2nd Place Overall Design Documentation on RoboBoat 2023 by RoboNation in March 2023.
